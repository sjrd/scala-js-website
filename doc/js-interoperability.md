title: JavaScript interoperability
---
{% include JB/setup %}

A key feature of Scala.js is its interoperability with JavaScript code, which
far exceeds that of many other languages targeting JavaScript. Except of course
for languages that translate almost litterally to JavaScript (e.g.,
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)).

Scala.js exhibits both means to call JavaScript APIs from Scala.js, and to be
called from JavaScript code.
